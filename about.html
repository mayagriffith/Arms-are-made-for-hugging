      <h1>About Us!</h1>

      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>

      <p> Gun violence is an issue of increasing importance in the United States, especially with the 2020 elections in sight. We created this website the week after the El Paso and Dayton shootings. Those tragedies continued to not only fuel the fear we feel when in school and public places, but also anger, because our government isn’t taking the right measures to protect us. We hope to encourage and give resources to the younger generation to put their future in their own hands, and to encourage people to fight for what they believe in. </p>
